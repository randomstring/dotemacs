# Configutation Files for Emacs

There are many .emacs files, this one is mine.


## Fonts

Picking DejaVu Mono spaced font. Top condeners were DejaVu, Inconsolata (-dz and -g) versions, and the Mac New Courier font. I've fallen out of love with Inconsolata-dz because the annoying -dz in the name confuses so many font parsers. Including Emacs. The Mac's New Courier has a nice feel, but the 1/l/O/0 characters are too similar. Microsoft's Consolata looks great, but requires either buying the fonts or installing Microsoft Office. DejaVu is Open Source and has extensive Unicode support.

## Mac Compatibility

Stoped using the default emacs that ships with Mac. This emacs is old (version 22) and doesn't play well with iTerm2.

## Background Colors

Background is black to avoid wearing out the eyes or lighting up the room (or airplane) when programming in low-light situations.

Foreground is almost white: #eeeeee.
